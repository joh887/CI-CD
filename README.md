What is CI/CD?

CI/CD refers to the process of automating all stages from application development to deployment to increase efficiency and speed, being able to frequently deploy applications to the users. CI stands for 'Continuous Integration', where debugging and code changes in an application are periodically built, tested, and merged into a shared repertoire. After the code built and tested in CI is verified and is concluded that it can be deployed to users, the automation process of releasing it to the user as soon as it is verified and ready, is called CD standing for â€˜Continuous Delivery.

What are some tools that are used for this and why are they used?

The process of CI is essential to find and fix bugs quickly, improve the quality of the software, and accelerate the time to validate and release new updates. While CI means building, testing, and merging source code, whereas CD means developers go beyond the repository and release into the customer's production environment. CD can support the software to maintain a reliable version at any time, and the user of the service may receive the latest version of production as soon as possible, minimizing the effort to deploy. Some of the tools used in such CI/CD are Jenkins, CircleCi, Atlassian Bamboo, or GitLab which supports building pipelines for software development projects, establishing build automation, and automating deployment and testing.
